# Trees
* Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees are a data structure often used in software. A Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree is an example of what a file system may look like. For balanced Binary Search Trees search time is O(log n).

## Challenge

* Write instance methods of a Binary Tree pre-order, in-order and post-order which show a list of the tree values in these traversal orders. Write instance methods of a Binary Search Tree add and contains which update and read a Binary Search Tree for a value in time O(log n).

## Approach & Efficiency

* API methods of instances of a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree pre-order, in-order and post-order take Big O time O(n) and space O(1). The API method of instances of a Binary Search Tree add and contains take Big O time O(log n) and space O(1).

## API 

* The API instance methods for a Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree are pre-order, in-order and post-order. The API instance methods for a Binary Search Tree are add and contains.
