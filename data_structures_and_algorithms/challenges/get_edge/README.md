# Code Challenge: Class 37

## Overview
- Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?


- we will create a function that checks if there is an edge or series of consecutive edges that exists between a list of nodes (represented by their values).If there is no such 'edge', we will return 'False : $0'.
If there is such an 'edge', we will return 'True : $[cost]'

## Challenge 
- Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. then return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Approach & Efficiency

- O(N^2) for time
- For space efficency it is O(N)
