# Code Challenge 27 - Merge Sort

Merge Sort on a given array.

* note : Merge sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It recursiveley splits each portion of the origin array until it's comparing only two arrays with a single element each. It then merges the sorted subarrays back together.

## Tests

- test_empty_list - Test that empty list is handled correctly.
- test_one_item_list - Test that single list item is handled correctly.
- test_two_item_list - Test that list with two items is handled correctly.
- test_many_item_list - Test that normal list is handled correctly.

## Challenge

- Provide a visual step through in BLOG.md for one of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Big O notation

- time <- O(n)
- space <- O(n)
