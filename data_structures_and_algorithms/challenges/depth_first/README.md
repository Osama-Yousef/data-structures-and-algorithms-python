# Code Challenge 38 - Graph Depth First Traversal
- Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph


## Challenge
- Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Big (O) notation
- walk()

  * time <- O(n)
  * space <- O(n)

- depth_first()

  * time <- O(1)
  * space <- O(1)
