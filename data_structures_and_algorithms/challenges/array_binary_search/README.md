# Challenge Summary
built the BinarySearch function to take in the desired inputs. we go through each element in a for loop checking to see if the element 
currently iterated on equals the second parameter value. if it does, pass the index of that value, if it never finds a match, return -1


## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of 
the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the
element does not exist.
