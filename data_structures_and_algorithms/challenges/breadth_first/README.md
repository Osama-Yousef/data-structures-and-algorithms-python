# Code Challenge 17 - Breadth First

* Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Tests

* test_empty_tree - If tree is empty return None.
* test_single_node - Test that binary tree with single item returns list with that single item.
* test_four_nodes - Test that binary tree with four nodes returns list with those four items.
* test_many_nodes - Test that binary tree with 10 nodes returns list with those 10 items.

## Challenge

* Write a function called breadth_first which takes a tree as input. Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

## Big O notation

* time <- O(n)
* space <- O(n)
